# i have to give an object for each html product card and send it to the ShopItems that will return the price for the product that was requested

# What i have to do now is to create a new table in the database called shop.
# Then i will add the categories and prices for each product in the table.
# When the user will press on some product all the info will be sent to the checkout page (and the user will be added to the checkout session).
# if the user bought the product he will be redirected to the /thanks page else an error will occur.
